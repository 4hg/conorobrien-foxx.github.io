# Prime envious pairs

## Mar 21 2018

Two numbers, $x$ and $y$, are envious of each other if $x$ has $n$ distinct prime factors that $y$ does not have, and $y$ has $n$ distinct prime factors that $x$ does not have. Symbolically,

$$n=\left\|\phi(x)-\phi(y)\right\|=\left\|\phi(y)-\phi(x)\right\|$$

where $\phi(a)$ is the set of primes $p_k$ dividing $a$.

Find the number of distinct envious pairs $(x, y)$ for which $n$ is prime and $1\le y\le 100$ and $1\le x\le y$.
