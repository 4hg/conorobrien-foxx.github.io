        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><i>Cubing</i> is perhaps slang for &ldquo;solving a twisty puzzle&rdquo;&mdash;not just Rubik's cubes, since there are many different types of cubes beyond those (and many producers of said cubes beyond Rubik's).</p> I enjoy cubing greatly, and own a few cubes myself. I don't speedsolve cubes <i>per se</i>, but I do record my personal bests for each cube I own.

        <p>A gift from a good friend, this is the better of the two 2x2's I owned, the other being a Rubik's brand. It's sustained all of the abuse (read: travel) that I've incurred on it quite well. (If it weren't for me, this cube would score a 5/5.)</p>

        <p>This was one of the first cubes I owned. The magnets are hardly noticeable, I think, but it turns quite well. When speedsolving this cube, the lack of corner-cutting is evident, leading to awkward, brief pauses of re-aligning the cube before continuing. This is also one of my favorite cubes to solve, due to how fun it is to turn.</p>
        
        <h3>Rubik's 2x2 (tiled; modified)</h3>

        <p>This is my first attempt at a cube mod. It was originally a regular ol' 2x2 (also my first 2x2). It turns decently for a Rubik's brand. I forgot what I was originally trying to do in modifying this, but after a good amount of time struggling with the pieces, I eventaully popped out one of the corners&hellip; breaking the corner in the process. Having broken the cube, I decided to pop off another corner to see if the same thing would happen. And it did. So I decided just to leave it alone, and this is the result.</p>
        <p>Solving this thing is much the same as a normal 2x2, except you can do corner permutations by moving a piece into certain axes of rotations. Decently-interesting, if you ask me. It's a bit harder to solve, since the piece seems to be constantly falling out of shape, not to mention I try to use its special property to solve it, which of course takes more time.</p>

        <p>I haven't solved this one yet. I tried using beginner's method on it, and it didn't work as well as I hoped it might have. Quite a tricky puzzle, and one that I have vowed to solve on my own. I don't know how to solve puzzles of higher orders than 3x3 yet, but I know that center-piece placement algorithms would <em>definitely</em> help me solve this&hellip;</p>
        <p>As for the turning quality, it's pretty eh. Re-aligning is a pain, and the aligned turns aren't that great when it is aligned. The outer layers turn pretty smoothly, though.</p>
