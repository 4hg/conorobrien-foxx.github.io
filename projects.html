        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>A page dedicated to going into a bit more depth on some of the stuff I have worked on, from various points throughout my life. I have been programming for quite some time, and have maintained a GitHub account since June 2015, so some of the projects vary in quality. This list is incomplete, and I will update it as I have time.</p>

        <p>This project is the result of a weekend Hackathon, <a href="https://www.tribehacks.com/">Cypher VII</a>, March 25&ndash;27, 2022. I collaborated with <a href="https://github.com/jcruxton">Jonathan Ruxton</a> to create a visual application using Java's swing components to simulate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>, but where the borders between cells can break down as a result of extended activity. The application also features an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model">Sandpiles</a>.</p>
        <p>I primarily worked on the display aspects of the application, while my partner worked on the logic of generations. We also had invaluable assistance from <a href="https://github.com/GreenGem-ButOnGitHub">Tetra</a>, who helped us generate and solidify the idea during the Hackathon.</p>

        <p>Quartic is a programming language with Assembly-esque syntax that compiles to the esoteric language <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/4">4</a>. The most interesting challenge in 4, and by extension, Quartic, is that there is a finite memory of 100 cells, each containing an arbitrarily large integer. I designed Quartic because I wanted to prove 4 to be Turing Complete by proof of emulation, and needed a simpler, more controlled way to organize my efforts. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ConorOBrien-Foxx/4Compiler/main/examples/quartic/turing-complete-min.quartic">This file</a> (snippet pictured above left) is an interpreter for the Turing Complete <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Boolfuck">Boolfuck</a> language, storing the data tape as a very large integer. The corresponding compiled 4 program is pictured above right.</p>
        <p>I wrote the Quartic compiler in Ruby, and it is able to compile to 4 and to <a href="https://dlang.org/">D</a>, and, by extension, to an executable file. The same compiler framework is also used to generate a "prettified" version of 4, and can help unobfuscate existing 4 source code files into (more) readable, commented code. The esolang page linked above features Quartic's specification.</p>
